# Conversational AI Automation Testing Suite

A comprehensive automation testing suite for conversational AI projects, featuring:

- **Botium Framework Integration** for automated chatbot interaction testing
- **PyRIT** for content safety and red-teaming of Large Language Models (LLMs)

## Overview

This repository contains automation projects for testing conversational AI systems.

- Automated test cases for chatbots using the Botium framework
- Data-driven testing with JSON scripts
- Content safety and adversarial testing for LLMs using PyRIT

---


## Features

- **Botium Chatbot Testing:**  
  Automate and validate chatbot responses for various customer scenarios with dynamic data support.

- **Data-Driven Testing:**  
  Use JSON files for flexible, scalable test case management.

- **Content Safety with PyRIT:**  
  Identify unsafe, biased, or adversarial outputs from LLMs.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (for Botium)
- **Python 3.8+** (for PyRIT)
- Clone this repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/yourusername/conversational-ai-testing.git
  cd conversational-ai-testing
  ```

---

## Botium Testing

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Botium

Edit `botium.json` with your chatbot connection details (e.g., DirectLine secret).

### 3. Add Test Scripts

Place your `.json` test scripts in the `convos/` directory.  
Each file represents a scenario (e.g., Account Balance, Next Bill Date).

### 4. Run Tests

```bash
node scripts/runTests.js
```

Test results will be printed in the console, showing each step and pass/fail status.

## Content Safety Testing with PyRIT

[PyRIT](https://github.com/microsoft/pyrit) is used for adversarial and content safety testing of LLMs.

### 1. Install PyRIT

```bash
pip install pyrit
```

### 2. Configure PyRIT

- Place your PyRIT scenarios and prompt files in the `pyrit/` directory.
- Configure your model endpoints and test cases as needed.

### 3. Run PyRIT Tests

```bash
cd pyrit
pyrit run --config your_config.yaml
```

Refer to [PyRIT documentation](https://github.com/microsoft/pyrit) for details on scenario configuration and result interpretation.

**Tips:**
- Update the `git clone` URL and other placeholders as needed.
- Add badges (build status, license, etc.) if you set up CI/CD later.
- Include sample test scripts in `convos/` and `pyrit/` for new users.

Let me know if you want a sample `convos/*.json` or a PyRIT config example!
